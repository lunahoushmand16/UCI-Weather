# UCI-Weather
# Weather Page Project

## Overview
We are building a weather page that fetches data from a weather API using JavaScript and displays it to users in an interactive and visually appealing way. The project is divided into three main areas: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each team member is assigned one area to focus on, but collaboration is encouraged to ensure the project functions smoothly.

## Team Roles and Responsibilities

### Person 1: HTML (Structure & Layout) -- Luna 
**Primary Responsibility:** Build the skeleton of the webpage.

**Tasks:**

- Create a search input field where users can enter their city or zip code.
- Add placeholders for dynamic weather data (e.g., today’s weather, forecast).
- Structure the table or grid for displaying the weather details.
- Ensure the HTML is semantic and accessible by using appropriate tags (e.g., `<header>`, `<section>`, `<table>`).

### Person 2: CSS (Design & Style) -- Daniel
**Primary Responsibility:** Style the page to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.

**Tasks:**
- Design and style the page with attractive colors, fonts, and spacing.
- Format the header, search box, weather table, and footer.
- Style the weather data table to be easy to read and visually engaging (e.g., color coding for temperature ranges).
- Implement responsive design using media queries to ensure the page works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Person 3: JavaScript (Functionality & API Integration) -- Jonathan
**Primary Responsibility:** Handle the dynamic aspects of the page, including fetching and displaying weather data.

**Tasks:**
- Set up an event listener for the search box to handle user input.
